    <!-- You can create three different types of dialog boxes alert, confirm, and prompt boxes.

The appearance of these dialog boxes is determined by the operating system and/or browser settings, they cannot be modified with the CSS. Also, dialog boxes are modal windows; when a dialog box is displayed the code execution stops, and resumes only after it has been dismissed.

In the following section we will discuss each of these dialog boxes in detail. -->

    <!-- An alert dialog box is the most simple dialog box. It enables you to display a short message to the user. It also includes OK button, and the user has to click this OK button to continue. -->

    <!-- A confirm dialog box allows user to confirm or cancel an action. A confirm dialog looks similar to an alert dialog
    but it includes a Cancel button along with the OK button.

    You can create confirm dialog boxes with the confirm() method. This method simply returns a Boolean value (true or
    false) depending on whether the user clicks OK or Cancel button. That's why its result is often assigned to a
    variable when it is used. -->


    <!-- The prompt dialog box is used to prompt the user to enter information. A prompt dialog box includes a text input
    field, an OK and a Cancel button.

    You can create prompt dialog boxes with the prompt() method. This method returns the text entered in the input field
    when the user clicks the OK button, and null if user clicks the Cancel button. If the user clicks OK button without
    entering any text, an empty string is returned -->
    <!-- The value returned by the prompt() method is always a string. -->
    <!-- Therefore, if you want to use the returned value as a number you must covert it or cast to Number, like this: var
    age = Number(prompt("What's your age?")); -->
    <script>
        // alert() method
        var message = "Hi there! Click OK to continue.";
        alert(message);
        /* The following line won't execute until you dismiss previous alert */
        alert("This is another alert box.");

// conform() method
        var result = confirm("Are you sure?");
        if (result) {
            document.write("You clicked OK button!");
        } else {
            document.write("You clicked Cancel button!");
        }


// prompt() method
var name = prompt("What's your name?");
if(name.length > 0 && name != "null") {
    document.write("<br>Hi, " + name);
} else {
    document.write("<br>Anonymous!");
}
    </script>
